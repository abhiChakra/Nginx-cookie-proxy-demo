# todo-app-medium-demo

Simple mock application for a series of technical Medium articles. A basic todo-list where a user can login with credentials and add/delete items from the list which appears on their home page. For simplicity, app has pre-set two users, and so will not feature a sign-up page.

Consists of isolated Application-Server (flask framework served through WSGIsever) and Web-Server (react framework served through Nginx using reverse-proxy).
